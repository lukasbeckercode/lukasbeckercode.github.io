<h1 id="arduinopdu">ArduinoPDU</h1>
<p>A simple communication protocol for communication between any device (e.g. PC) and an Arduino via Serial communication loosly based
	on the APDU protocol used in smart cards. </p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="storing-and-reading-data">Storing and reading data</h3>
<p>The library provides a String array called records. You can store and read data here either using the according
	commands, or do it directly in your arduino sketch! </p>
<h3 id="better-pin-control">Better pin control</h3>
<p>Internal checks keep track of the pinModes set to each pin and strictly enforces these pinModes.
	This means that a pin set to <em>INPUT</em> cannot be set to <em>HIGH</em> or <em>LOW</em> by this library.
	The arduino allows the change of the pinMode and this library does as well, however the pin has to be specifically reset
	and set to a new pinMode to avoid mistakes in this matter</p>
<h3 id="customisation">Customisation</h3>
<p>Commands 9000 to 9999 are custom commands, so their handling can easily be implemented by anyone with a little experience
	in arduino development. Just take a quick look at the example.ino sketch. <br />
	Although pointers are used to retrieve all the parts of the command, there is no need for a user of this library to
	understand pointers at all. Just put the &quot;&amp;&quot; signs exactly where they are in the example.ino sketch
	and everything works. </p>

<h3 id="class-9x">Class 9X</h3>
<p>This command class can be personalized in the arduino sketch by the user. This comes in handy if you need
	functionality that isn&#39;t (yet) covered by this library. An example of how this can be used can be found
	in the example.ino sketch. <br />
	Since this command class is defined as 9X, you have CLAINS 9000 to 9999 available to your liking <br />
	Example: 90010090 -&gt; user defines, that 9001 means to turn a stepper motor as many steps as defined in
	the data field (90 in this example). The library itself doesn&#39;t return any Status word now. For semantic reasons,
	you should use SW9000 as an indicator of success, failure status word can be chosen freely. <br />
	This apdu always must be of even length as well! </p>
<h2 id="status-words">Status words</h2>
<p>Status words can be compared to the HTTP Response Codes. <br /> </p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="i-sent-a-command-and-i-get-6700-as-a-response-then-nothing-happens">I sent a command, and I get 6700 as a response, then nothing happens</h3>
<p>This most likely means that the length of your command was not even. For parsing purposes,
	only commands with even lengths are permitted. <br />
	Examples: </p>
<ul>
	<li>01010003123 -&gt; this is 11 chars long, so odd: returns 6700</li>
	<li>010100041234 -&gt; 12 chars long, so even: returns 12349000  </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the Arduino doesn&#39;t do anything if any status word other than 9000 is returned. <br />
	Another possibility is, that the clains part has a length other than 4. So, for example </p>
<ul>
	<li>01 returns 6700 </li>
	<li>0100 returns &quot;Hello World!9000&quot;<h3 id="i-sent-a-command-and-i-get-6800-as-a-response-then-nothing-happens">I sent a command, and I get 6800 as a response, then nothing happens</h3>
		The command you sent is unknown to the library. If you meant to use an internal command, check for typos and look at Valid
		commands section of the Document. If you meant to use a custom command, make sure it starts with a &quot;9&quot;. <h3 id="i-tried-to-set-a-pin-to-high-but-i-get-6986-as-a-response">I tried to set a pin to high, but I get 6986 as a response</h3>
		This means your pinMode is either not set at all, or set to be an <em>INPUT</em> <br />
		Try the following(example uses pin 13, so replace all the 13&#39;s with your desired Pin): </li>
	<li>Send the following command: <ul>
		<li>031113</li>
		<li>if this returns &quot;9000&quot;, continue. </li>
		<li>if this returns &quot;6985&quot;, stop here and read the next section on 6985</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Test, if this fixed the issue: <ul>
		<li>030113</li>
		<li>should return &quot;9000&quot;</li>
		<li>pin 13 (or whichever pin you used) should be set to HIGH now</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If this didn&#39;t work, please open an issue on this repo </p>
<h3 id="i-tried-to-set-a-pinmode-using-either-0310-or-0311-but-i-get-6985-as-an-answer">I tried to set a pinMode using either 0310 or 0311, but I get 6985 as an answer</h3>
<p>This means the pin you are trying to assign a pinMode to already is used. You can either use a different or do the following: </p>
<ul>
	<li>check to which pinMode your desired pin is set currently<ul>
		<li>Send 030113(replace 13 with the desired pin again)</li>
		<li>SW 9000 means it&#39;s an <em>OUTPUT</em> , SW 6986 means it&#39;s an <em>INPUT</em> </li>
		<li>if the current pinMode is the desired one, you&#39;re done here, everything works should work fine.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>if the current pinMode isn&#39;t the one you want: <ul>
		<li>send 039013(replace 13 with desired pin) </li>
		<li>set the new pinMode</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>if you want to reset all active pins <ul>
		<li>send 0399</li>
		<li><b> CAUTION: THIS RESETS ALL THE PINS, THEY CANNOT BE USED WITHOUT REASSIGNING A PINMODE </b></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Development</h2>
<p>I am continuously developing TestNG tests in Java. Each command is tested for good case and bad case.<br />
